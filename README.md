# DaddyHood
=========

Social Networking tool for fathers powered by [Python](http://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [lessCSS](http://lesscss.org/).
  

This is a Django project I created for my RocketU bootcamp final demo day. You can play with my web application by following the instructions below:



## Setup

  Clone this repo and install the deps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/laudbrian/DaddyHood.git
$ cd DaddyHood-master
```

  Run the app:

SQLlite server listening on port 8000
```

Have fun!
